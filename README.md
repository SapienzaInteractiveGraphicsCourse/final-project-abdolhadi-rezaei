# Bounce Game
The game was inspired by a famous game called
BOUNCE which was published and launched by
Nokia.
The game developed in this project is similar to the
original BOUNCE game and also simulates a lot of
objects for gravity, friction, elasticity, joined bodies,
collision, etc using some javascript libraries.
I have added also some functional for make it more
user friendly, for example showing different
messages in different situation.
